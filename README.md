# Artificial Intelligence Resources
Artificial Intelligence is advancing in an incredible fast pace and staying up to date with the state-of-the-art research is, sometimes, overwhelming.
This repository is my "reading list", a collection of interesting papers, courses, blogs, videos and other resources related to Machine Learning and Cognitive Systems in general.

## Papers

### Computational Cognitive Science
* [Building Machines That Learn and Think Like People](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00289) -  One one my favorite papers. Discusses the elements of human cognitition that are still missing in current Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning approaches.

* [Human-level concept learning through probabilistic program induction](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/Papers/Science-2015-Lake-1332-8.pdf) -  A different approach to learning concepts from few data, like humans do.

### Deep Learning

* [A guide to convolution arithmetic for deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07285) (2016) - "We introduce a guide to help deep learning practitioners understand and manipulate convolutional neural network architectures.".

* [DeCAF: A Deep Convolutional Activation Feature for Generic Visual Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1531) - "We evaluate whether features extracted from the activation of a deep convolutional network trained in a fully supervised fashion on a large, fixed set of object recognition tasks can be re- purposed to novel generic tasks".

* [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) - "Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously".

* [Wide & Deep Learning for Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07792) - "In this paper, we present Wide & Deep learning - jointly trained wide linear models and deep neural networks - to combine the benefits of memorization and generalization for recommender systems".

* [ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-) (2012) - "We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.3 million high-resolution images in the LSVRC-2010 ImageNet training set into the 1000 different classes".

### Self-Driving Cars
* [End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07316) - "We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to map raw pixels from a single front-facing camera directly to steering commands".

* [Learning a Driving Simulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01230) - "Comma.ai's approach to Artificial Intelligence for self-driving cars is based on an agent that learns to clone driver behaviors and plans maneuvers by simulating future events in the road. This paper illustrates one of our research approaches for driving simulation".
